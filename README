This project aims to predict future yields of bonds using artificial neural networks.
The project is part of my finals project for my HXX(The Higher Commercial Examination Programme)   

The input data is based on a series of macroeconomic indicators. 
The data is split between CSV files and webscrabed links.

To install, download the project, setup a conda env and run "pip install requirements.txt".
After that run the main.py
